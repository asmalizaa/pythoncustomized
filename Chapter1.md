# Computer Programming and Python

Python has become one of the most popular programming languages in the world in recent years. It's used in everything from machine learning to building websites and software testing. It can be used by developers and non-developers alike.

Python is a computer programming language often used to build websites and software, automate tasks, and conduct data analysis. Python is a general-purpose language, meaning it can be used to create a variety of different programs and isn’t specialized for any specific problems. This versatility, along with its beginner-friendliness, has made it one of the most-used programming languages today.

Stack Overflow's 2022 Developer Survey revealed that Python is the fourth most popular programming language, with respondents saying that they use Python almost 50 percent of the time in their development work. Survey results also showed that Python is tied with Rust as the most-wanted technology, with 18% percent of developers who aren't using it already saying that they are interested in learning Python.

### What is Python used for?

Python is commonly used for developing websites and software, task automation, data analysis, and data visualization. Since it’s relatively easy to learn, Python has been adopted by many non-programmers such as accountants and scientists, for a variety of everyday tasks, like organizing finances.

"Writing programs is a very creative and rewarding activity,” says University of Michigan and Coursera instructor Charles R Severance in his book Python for Everybody. “You can write programs for many reasons, ranging from making your living to solving a difficult data analysis problem to having fun to helping someone else solve a problem."

What can you do with python? Some things include:
- Data analysis and machine learning
- Web development
- Automation or scripting
- Software testing and prototyping
- Everyday tasks

The Compiler and Interpreter, both have similar works to perform. Interpreters and Compilers convert the Source Code (HLL) to Machine Code (understandable by Computer). In general, computer programs exist in High-Level Language that a human being can easily understand. But computers cannot understand the same high-level language, so for computers, we have to convert them into machine language and make them readable for computers. In this article, we are going to see the differences between them.

### Compiler

The Compiler is a translator which takes input i.e., High-Level Language, and produces an output of low-level language i.e. machine or assembly language. The work of a Compiler is to transform the codes written in the programming language into machine code (format of 0s and 1s) so that computers can understand.

- A compiler is more intelligent than an assembler it checks all kinds of limits, ranges, errors, etc.
- But its program run time is more and occupies a larger part of memory. It has a slow speed because a compiler goes through the entire program and then translates the entire program into machine codes.

#### Roles of a Compiler

For Converting the code written in a high-level language into machine-level language so that computers can easily understand, we use a compiler. Converts basically convert high-level language to intermediate assembly language by a compiler and then assembled into machine code by an assembler.

#### Advantages of Compiler

- Compiled code runs faster in comparison to Interpreted code.
- Compilers help in improving the security of Applications.
- As Compilers give Debugging tools, which help in fixing errors easily.

#### Disadvantages of Compiler

- The compiler can catch only syntax errors and some semantic errors.
- Compilation can take more time in the case of bulky code.

### Interpreter

An Interpreter is a program that translates a programming language into a comprehensible language. The interpreter converts high-level language to an intermediate language. It contains pre-compiled code, source code, etc.

- It translates only one statement of the program at a time.
- Interpreters, more often than not are smaller than compilers.

#### Role of an Interpreter

The simple role of an interpreter is to translate the material into a target language. An Interpreter works line by line on a code. It also converts high-level language to machine language.

#### Advantages of Interpreter

- Programs written in an Interpreted language are easier to debug.
- Interpreters allow the management of memory automatically, which reduces memory error risks.
- Interpreted Language is more flexible than a Compiled language.

#### Disadvantages of Interpreter

- The interpreter can run only the corresponding Interpreted program.
- Interpreted code runs slower in comparison to Compiled code.
